    <h2>The Araw ng Dabaw Celebration and Garbo sa Dabaw</h2>
    <p><em>by: SR Pasaporte</em></p>
    <p>
        The Araw ng Dabaw celebration is one of the most highly anticipated events in Davao City, Philippines. It is a celebration of the city’s founding and showcases the rich culture and heritage of the Davaoeños. As part of the 86th Araw ng Dabaw celebration, the Pasidungog 2023: Garbo sa Dabaw is held to recognize the outstanding individuals, civic groups, and companies that have contributed to the city’s growth and development.
    </p>
    <p>
        One aspect of this recognition is the giving of certificates and plaques to companies that have demonstrated an exceptional level of participation and engagement in the Public Employment Service Office’s (PESO) activities. These companies invest time, resources, and effort to ensure that the job fairs are successful. By giving them a plaque of recognition, they are acknowledged for their hard work and contribution to the success of various activities.
